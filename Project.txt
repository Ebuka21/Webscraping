NOTES:

- After obtaining all the information, it is stored in a dictionary
- This dictionary is in turn written to a file
- the file is named with date added to it for more distinction
- the file can then be read into a pandas dataframe later on
* consider storing the file in csv format using | as separator rather than , because of the features column which contains a number of items in it
- in the dataframe, analysis can occur
	- check the most common amount
	- is if there is a particular area with more houses for rent
	- look at the common features that are mentioned
	- possible that some data is missing, giving room for assumptions. Assumptions will be stated below

Assumptions:
- Every house has a toilet
- Every house has a bathroom
- 


converting string containing dictionary to dictionary
- using the ast library (importing it)
- using the function .literal_eval(x)

Excel file
function dict_to_excel made to take the dictionary created that contained all the information and put it in an excel sheet.
done using pandas for easy context
convert dictionary to dataframe and from dataframe to excel
